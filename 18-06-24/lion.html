    <h2 class="title">General characteristics</h2>
    <p class="content">The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and short legs. Size and appearance vary
        considerably between the sexes. The male’s outstanding characteristic is his mane, which varies between
        different individuals and populations. It may be entirely lacking; it may fringe the face; or it may be full and
        shaggy, covering the back of the head, neck, and shoulders and continuing onto the throat and chest to join a
        fringe along the belly.The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and short legs. Size and

    <h2 class="title">Hunting</h2>
    <p class="content">Lions prey on a large variety of animals ranging in size from rodents and baboons to Cape (or African) buffalo
        and hippopotamuses, but they predominantly hunt medium- to large-sized hoofed animals such as wildebeests,
        zebras, and antelopes. Prey preferences vary geographically as well as between neighbouring prides. Lions are
        known to take elephants and giraffes, but only if the individual is young or especially sick. They readily eat
        any meat they can find, including carrion and fresh kills that they scavenge or forcefully steal from hyenas,
        cheetahs, or wild dogs. Lionesses living in open savanna do most of the hunting, whereas males typically
        appropriate their meals from the female’s kills. However, male lions are also adept hunters, and in some areas
        they hunt frequently. Pride males in scrub or wooded habitat spend less time with the females and hunt most of
        their own meals. Nomadic males must always secure their own food.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="title">Conservation status</h2>
    <p class="content">Lions disappeared from North America about 10,000 years ago, from the Balkans about 2,000 years ago, and from
        Palestine during the Crusades. By the 21st century their numbers had dwindled to a few tens of thousands, and
        those outside national parks are rapidly losing their habitat to agriculture. The International Union for the
        Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as vulnerable, and several subspecies have died out. At present
        the lion’s main stronghold is in sub-Saharan Africa, and the Asiatic lion exists only as a remnant population
        made up of approximately 500 to 700 individuals inhabiting India’s Gir National Park on the Kathiawar Peninsula.
        However, the Asiatic lion’s close genetic similarity with the now-extinct Barbary lion has raised hopes among
        conservationists that a restored population of the latter may be established in North Africa.</p>
